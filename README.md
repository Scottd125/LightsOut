# AllPay - Lights Out

Implementation of the Lights Out game. Created using C# Forms.

## How to play

The player is presented with a grid of lights that are either on or off to begin with. The goal of Lights Out is to turn off all of the lights by clicking on them to switch them on or off. Each light that is clicked by the player toggles that light as well as toggling adjacent lights from the clicked light (Up, down, left, right).
